/**
 * HardFaultHandler_C:
 *
 * This is called from the HardFault_Handler which over-rides the WEAK definition of HardFault_Handler with a pointer the
 * Fault Stack as the parameter.
 *
 * Then this code reads the values from the stack and places them into local variables so they can be examined.
 *
 * There are various Fault Status and Address Registers to help decode the cause of the fault.
 *
 * The function ends with a BKPT instruction to force control back into the debugger
 *
 * Refer to http://support.code-red-tech.com/CodeRedWiki/DebugHardFault
 *
 * And to http://www.freertos.org/Debugging-Hard-Faults-On-Cortex-M-Microcontrollers.html
 *

 * Cortex M4 exception handling: http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0439b/ch03s09s01.html
 * Cortex M0 exception handing:  http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0497a/BABBFABJ.html
 *
 * The first register of interest is the program counter.
 *
 * In the code, below the variable stacked_pc contains the program counter value.
 *
 * When the fault is a precise fault, the stacked_pc holds the address of the instruction that was executing when the hard fault
 * (or other fault) occurred. When the fault is an imprecise fault, then additional steps are required to find the address of the
 * instruction that caused the fault.
 *
 * To find the instruction at the address held in the stacked_pc variable, either...
 * Open an assembly code window in the debugger, and manually enter the address to view the assembly instructions at that address, or
 * Open the break point window in the debugger, and manually define an execution or access break point at that address.
 * With the break point set, restart the application to see which line of code the instruction relates to.
 *
 * Knowing the instruction that was being executed when the fault occurred allows you to determine which other register values are
 * also of interest.
 *
 * For example, if the instruction was using the value of R7 as an address, then the value of R7 needs to be know.
 * Further, examining the assembly code, and the C code that generated the assembly code, will show what R7 actually holds
 * (it might be the value of a variable, for example).
 *
 * Handling Imprecise Faults:
 *
 * ARM Cortex-M faults can be precise or imprecise.
 *
 * If the IMPRECISERR bit (bit 2) is set in the Bus Fault Status Register (or BFSR, which is at address 0xE000ED29), then the fault
 * is imprecise.
 *
 * It is harder to determine the cause of an imprecise fault because the fault will not necessarily occur concurrently with the
 * instruction that caused the fault.
 *
 * For example, if writes to memory are cached then there might be a delay between an assembly instruction initiating a write to
 * memory and the write to memory actually occurring.
 *
 * If such a delayed write operation is invalid (for example, a write is being attempted to an invalid memory location) then an
 * imprecise fault will occur, and the program counter value obtained using the code above will not be the address of the assembly
 * instruction that initiated the write operation.
 *
 * Turn off write buffering by setting the DISDEFWBUF bit (bit 1) in the Auxiliary Control Register (or ACTLR) compile and
 * re-run the test and then the imprecise fault becoming a precise fault, which makes the fault easier to debug.
 *
 *  Note: this will come at the cost of slower program execution.
 *
 *  I hope this helps you track down this hard to find HardFaults
